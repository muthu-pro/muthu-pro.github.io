                    He undertook “renunciation” of family because of the harsh
                    reprimand by his father.
              </p>
              <p>He went first to Vijayawada in Andhra State. Then he proceeded
                to Hyderabad and Kolkatta.</p>
                <p> He reached Kaasi (Varanasi), a noted sacred town of Hindu
                    pilgrimage on the bank of the River Ganges. There he could not
                    get free meals easily at choultries which exclusively fed
                    Brahmins forbidding other Hindu castes.</p>
                    <p>Having starved severely for some days, this handsome young
                        man Ramasamy found no other better way than to enter a
                        choultry with the appearance of a Brahmin wearing a thread on
                        his bare chest. But his moustache betrayed him. So the gatekeeper not only prevented his entry but also pushed him rudely
                        to the street.</p>
                        <p> At that moment, as the feast was over inside the choultry, the
                            leaves with food left over were thrown at the street.
                            The unbearable burning of starvation for the past few days
                            forced Ramasamy to compete with the street - dogs in eating the
                            remnants of food in the leaves.</p>
                            <p>While eating that food, the eyes of Ramasamy looked at the
                                letters carved at the frontal wall of the building. They revealed
                                the truth that the choultry exclusively occupied by the highest
                                caste viz., Brahmins, had been built only by a wealthy merchant
                                of Dravidian Race from Tamil Nadu.</p>
                                <p>Suddenly in the mind of this young man, some questions could
                                    have sparked such as:
                                    “Why and how the Brahmins can obstruct the Dravidians from
                                    taking meals in the choultry although the choultry was built with
                                    the money of a Dravidian Philanthropist? Why the Brahmins
                                    behaved so mercilessly and fanatically as to push the
                                    communities of the Dravidian race even to starvation - death by
                                    adamantly enforcing their evil casteism?”</p>
                                    <p>No justifiable answers came to convince the judicious thinking
                                        of Periyar on the above questions.</p>
                                        <p>The disgrace inflicted by the Brahmins at KAASI upon him
                                            without the least mercy, made a deep wound in the heart of
                                            Periyar and it inflamed intense hatred towards that Aryan race
                                            and their creation of innumerable Gods.</p>
                                            <p>Though Kaasi (Varanasi) has been acclaimed as the most “sacred
                                                town” by the Brahmins, the worst ugly scenes of immoral
                                                activities, prostitution, cheating, looting, begging crowds for
                                                alms, floating dead bodies on the River Ganges turned Periyar to

                        those days) when the price of a single gold sovereign was not

                                    clothes and began to wear Khadhi. Also he forced all the
                                    members of his family, including his mother, aged 80 years to
                                    wear Khadhi dress only!</p>

                    The policy of Prohibition of Liquors was first conceived only at
the house of Periyar. When Gandhi came to Erode and stayed at
his residence, his wife Nagammal and his sister Kannammal
explained unbearable agony of the wives tortured by their
drunkard husbands and strongly stressed to draw a policy on
prohibition of liquors. They also pleaded to launch an agitation
in this regard.
              </p>
              <p>Their worthy suggestion was accepted at once by Gandhi. He
                announced that the Congress party men should undertake
                picketing in front of toddy shops throughout the country for
                urging the British Government to implement the policy of liquorprohibition</p>
                <p> To accomplish the command of Gandhi for upholding the policy
                    of liquor - prohibition, Periyar had cut and uprooted more than 
                    500 coconut - trees in his vast groves, from which toddy was
                    procured. Such was his commitment to prohibition</p>

                        prohibitory law order.</p>
                        <p>In the temple town of Vaikom, the low caste people (Ezhavas)
                            were not allowed to walk in the streets around the temple. So
                            that ‘Sathyagraha’ - agitation was started by local Congress party
                            people.</p>
                            <p>They requested Periyar to come from Tamil Nadu to take up the
                                leadership of Sathyagraha. He led the agitation. Hence, he was
                                arrested and sent to jail. In that case, he was sentenced twice to
                                undergo imprisonment for six months for each term. The
                                Sathyagraha went on for one year.</p>
                                <p>Then the streets were thrown open to the Untouchables.</p>
                                <p>That courageous social sacrifice and fight for the human rights,
                                    secured victory. The title of honour as ‘Hero of Vaikom’ was
                                    conferred on Periyar.</p>

                    Discrimination was shown by V.V.S. Iyer, a Brahmin in charge
of the National Training School hostel called ‘Gurukulam’ at
Cheranmaadhevi near Thirunelveli, between the students of
Brahmin caste and the Non- Brahmin castes, although that
hostel-attached institution was funded by Tamil Nadu Congress
Committee and also by Dravidian philanthropists
              </p>
              <p>V.V.S. Iyer’s caste-oriented approach in favour of the Brahmin
                students segregating the Dravidian students with castefanaticism, infuriated Periyar. Hence this Great humanist
                resigned the post of Secretary of Tamil Nadu Congress
                Committee.</p>
                <p>However Periyar was then elected as the President of Tamil
                    Nadu Congress Committee. He presided over the provincial conference of the Congress party
                    held at Tiruvannamalai in November - 1924.</p>
                    <p>Since 1920, he had been moving a resolution in Congress
                        conferences demanding the Communal Reservation in
                        Government jobs and education for the Non-Brahmins
                        (Dravidians) to drive out their degradation and attain higher
                        positions in all spheres of life on par with the dominating
                        Brahmins. Similarly he proposed such a resolution at
                        Tiruvannamalai Congress Conference also</p><p>But it was defeated by the Brahmins as they plotted at the
                            Conferences of Tirunelveli (1920), Thanjavur (1921), Tiruppur
                            (1922) and Salem (1923).</p><p> Speaking at a public meeting at Salem, Periyar cautioned that
                                unless the right of communal representation for the NonBrahmins was attained during the British Rule itself, the
                                Brahmin supremacy could not at all be ended and the Dravidian
                                race had to suffer under the tyranny of ‘BRAHMNOCRACY’
                                (The “Hindu” Centenary Special Number: page 337). Thus he
                                even coined that new word.</p>

shortly a parallel conference of Non-Brahmins.
In his address, Periyar declared that the difference of racial
identity between the Dravidians and the Aryans (Brahmins) had
always been existing from very ancient times and its prevalence
in the Congress Party also could not at all be denied. Therefore,
he stressed the compelling need of the Dravidians to preserve the
SELF-RESPECT of their race, language, and culture which had
been degraded by the Brahminical dominance of their castesystem and superstition of Hindu religion.

‘Untouchability’ stubbornly practised by the Brahmins could not

                The first provincial conference of Self-Respect Movement was
                organised by Periyar at Chengalpattu in February 1929. Mr.
                W.P.A. Soundara Pandian, presided over that conference.

		</p>   
        <p>Periyar introduced a new rationalist marriage system called
            ‘Self-Respect Marriage’. While conducting it, all the religious
            rituals and uttering of ‘Mantras’ by Brahmins in Sanskrit should
            be forbidden. It would be enough for the new couple to garland
            each other and declare the wedding affirmation in mothertongue. The marriage should not be arranged pompously but
            should be very economic. These are the conditions laid down by
            Periyar for his reformatory wedlock system. By this new
            matrimonial arrangement, he has secularized the marriage. Any
            person irrespective of any religion could conduct the marriage by
            asking the bride and the bridegroom to exchange garlands and
            make a declaration for becoming life-partners.</p> 
            <p>Besides this new wedding system, Periyar also encouraged intercaste marriages and widow marriages. </p>
